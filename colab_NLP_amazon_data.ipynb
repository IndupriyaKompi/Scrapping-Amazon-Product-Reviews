       "'  If you own an earlier Paperwhite and it\\'s still functional there is no compelling reason to buy the Gen 4 \"All-New\" Paperwhite ( Amazon misleadingly refers to this as \"10th Generation\". It\\'s a 10th generation Kindle e-reader but only the 4th generation Paperwhite ) unless a limited degree of water resistance (not waterproof as they claim) is important to you or you want Bluetooth capability for Audiobooks. Neither of these are remotely important nor needed by me in an e-reader and Audiobooks are handled better by smaller, lighter and less power hungry devices. The additional storage is coals to Newcastle as Amazon\\'s cloud can hold any overstorage needs an owner has. Personally, I don\\'t know anyone who has ever run out of onboard storage on any Kindle, including the very first keyboard models, despite loading them with hundreds of books. The much touted, by Amazon, thinness and lightness of this edition is, in my opinion, overblown. Yes it is slightly thinner and slightly lighter but not paradigm changing. Also beware: the supplied micro USB cable packaged with mine will not fit into the device, maybe yours will. All in all I find it breathtakingly stupid and/or venal of Amazon to ship a device so poorly engineered and quality controlled as to not have a functional charging cable. I bought this Kindle solely to replace a Gen 3 whose battery was failing. Amazon took every other Paperwhite edition off the website and left no choice but this one at $10 more than the previous edition. It\\'s a Kindle, it\\'s fine, but it\\'s no game changer. If you buy it thinking it is I think you\\'ll be disappointed.'"

       " ' i own a kindle fire which was only about 50 a couple of years ago i ordered the new paperwhite because it promised longer battery time between charges but i returned it immediately because you cant adjust the background light at all and there was very little adjustment possible for font size i much prefer the fire even if i have to plug it in to the charger daily an important feature that was missing from the paperwhite is the ability to set a time that it changes from bluewhite to amber light when you are near bedtime',\n",

       " ' i just ordered another paperwhite because like the lasts 5 or 6 i owned stopped accepting any charger to take a charge a its ridiculous for amazon to consistently include this flawed design and b given that i have to replace it so often and always when my current kindle needs a charge and is ready to die it should be shipped to me overnight when i order a new one but this one will take six days when i will be without my reader and finally c i spent forever on the amazon we3bpage trying to communicate with a human to ask if it would be possible to overnight the new paperwhite given my circumstances and perhaps stupid loyalty but it is impossible even the chat function is run by a bot that only allows you to give one of a number of provided answers i am furious with amazon at the moment and i want to warn everyone ordering these just what thy are in store for maybe 910 months to use this product and i really want my replacement shipped overnight but alas it is impossible to make that argument or request ',\n",
       " ' this has been my first kindle and most likely my last i downloaded a book that i really wanted to read and i had no problems with that when i was finished reading for the night i turned off the kindle the next day i turned it back on i kept on waiting for my book to load and the only message that i received for hours was waking up i decided to return this product and buy the book instead at least i can open a page immediately very disappointed',\n",
       " ' i rest my kindle on flat surfaces to read have done so for several years until i bought this model',\n",
       " ' lots of people have their own reviews but be aware that although this is still marketed as having 3g connectivity apparently it isnt being offered with 3g connectivity anymore this was a major annoyance for me when it arrived i had searched to find the 3g option and never found a distinction to choose that or only wifi so since amazon was still marketing it with 3g i inferred it must come automatically with any of these models nope',\n",
       " ' with spending so much more time indoors the last couple months i found myself wanting to start reading more but unable to visit so many stores that were closed down the kindle has been exactly was i was looking for as the last reader i had used was over ten years ago which was less than impressive',\n",
       " ' i picked up this new kindle because of the waterproof feature theres nothing else to recommend it over the gen 6 kindle which ive been using for 4 years i read extensively while sunbathing so the waterproof feature was a welcome upgrade for using outdoors around water during the summer months however i have found that this kindle cannot take the heat earlier today i was reading outside in the sun on an 82 degree day with the kindle inside a cover and after only 55 minutes an error message popped up saying that it was overheating and would be suspending soon this was the 2nd time that has happened so unless youre only going to use this device inside in a cool environment you might want to skip this until the engineers get their act together and figure out how to make this new kindle work as well as all the other previous models i have spent hours reading outdoors in much hotter temps than 82 degrees using my 4year old gen 6 model and it continues to work perfectly',\n",
       " ' the kindle paperwhite is my first ereader and i have a massive petpeeve with it the power button is on the bottom which means that i cant read while my kindle is standing up ie on a table leaning against the wall for handsfree reading because the weight of the kindle on its own powerbutton triggers it to turn off furthermore the most comfortable position for me to hold the kindle with my hands is to make a sort of lshape with my thumb along the side and pinkyfinger holding the base with the rest of my fingers supporting the back of the kindle there have been several instances where im completely absorbed in a book not paying attention to what my fingers are doing and my pinkyfinger hits the powerbutton and turns off the kindle if only they had put the powerbutton on the top or side or programed an option to rotate the content on the screen 180degrees',\n",
       " ' overall i like this devise its light weight fits in my hand and is easy to use however since is read a lot and have ms i like to put the devise on a little stand rather than hold it all the time since the power switch is on the bottom every time the devise gets bumped it turns off i wish i had returned it within the return period of time if it werent for this problem i would give it 5 stars',\n",
       " ' microusb is crazy outdated i dont have anything that still uses those cables my solution was to buy a wireless charging receiver game changer',\n",
       " ' this is my first kindle and so far i am very pleased i was reading books using libby on my phoneipad but my eyes would get tired from the screen i would also get distracted from reading by seeing notifications or having the internet at my fingertips when i wanted to look something up i can still borrow books from libby which is what ultimately sold me i love the look of the eink and the battery life is amazing ive been using my device for about a month now reading every now and then and im still at 60 i only turn the wifi on when i have to download or a return a book to the library which definitely helps the battery last longer',\n",
       " ' i spent days reading reviews and weighing my options about this tablet and i never saw a review like this so i hope i can help someone else make a decision this kindle is ok its very small my cell phone isnt much bigger and i dont own a huge cell phone its black and white not a drop of color which shocked me for some reason there is no brick to charge it only a cord in the package which means you have to buy a separate accessory thats 20 just to be able to use it i found that sad and ridiculous the charge most certainly does not last weeks i charge mine on sundays and it does last all week when i read a few minutes at work each day and some at night but not weeks there is no way to access the app store which means if you use your local library overdrive like i do you have to download that on another device then find your books and have them sent to the kindle which is a gigantic pain in the booty i got 3 months free from kindle unlimited but i have yet to find a single book that i wanted to read on it its very limited on selections its not super user friendly i had to google how to even get out of a book once i was reading it i have difficulty navigating it and usually once i figure something out ive tried for so long to get there i cant remember how to do it for next time',\n",
       " ' update 6292020 not quite 8 months old and its become basically useless now only 1 star down from 4 it will not always download books and not remove those ive finished right now i have 3 books i still havent been able to download onto my kindle so im having to read them on my ipad and the page turning is very iffy',\n",
       " ' i bought this so i could read more and enjoy reading without dealing with apps from my phonekindle fire this software is so flipping slow and glitchy it drives me insane plus highlighting is a nightmare especially when the quote continues to the next page yeah good luck with that my highlights on goodreads are a mess from this see photos i have to highlight the words on each page separately and then add them in later on ugh highlighting is one of my favorite things about the kindle youd think in 13 years they would have figured out how to make this thing work and trust me i love ebooks and i am an avid ebook supporter but this just makes reading more frustrating guess i will go back to reading on my phone not having a glare isnt worth all the bs plus when you read in the dark and you switch pages it can sometimes flash a bright white page in your face i use the black paper with white font to keep it dark for my eyes',\n",
       " ' my first kindle was the kindle keyboard this was near perfect in every way for me as a student this new kindle is ok many good and a few bad things i will list them all here',\n",
       " ' the 10th generation kindle paperwhite with 32gb storage is the best ereader for me heres why',\n",
       " ' the books you buy on kindle will never be your property this turns out to be more than an academic point i recently had a fraud issue with my credit card and while going over purchases with the bank that services it accidentally flagged two minor amazon purchases as fraudulent the bank demanded that amazon refund payment to the bank and amazon shut down my account ie my whole amazon account and deleted my entire kindle library you have no downloaded items on this device this was over matter of maybe 30 total the kindle library redownloaded once i paid amazon nothing was lost and i have no doubt it was all pursuant to the many pages of terms and conditions that i signed but i now know who owns my kindle purchases and certainly will never make another one']"
