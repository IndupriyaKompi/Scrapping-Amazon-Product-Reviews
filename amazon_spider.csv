  After 10 15 minutes of use my ears started burning when I got home I noticed that I had bleeding open wounds on my ears located where the airpods rest. I'm glad I wasn't more seriously injured. The pain continued for over 6 hours even after washing the area.

Caught in war between Apple & Amazon,"
  I ordered these the 1st day they were available and received them today.  They connected easily but on the 1st song I played the audio started slowing down less than a minute in and distorted the vocals and music.  I thought maybe it‚Äôs just a glitch because they are only 75% charged so I charged them up and reconnected them and it was even worse than before.  I called Apple support and spoke to 2 women who were beyond slow and the opposite of geniuses.  I was told the 2nd one was a senior supervisor not sure what her qualifications were as she was as inept and unhelpful as her subordinate. After 37 minutes on the call timer and being on hold over 5x I hung up.  I‚Äôm going to the Apple store tomorrow.  So I went to the Apple store and with help from the guys there we were able to determine the music issue only happens with Amazon music -  which is my service of choice.  I‚Äôve been checking everyday for an update to fix this glitch.  Apple said they will take them back if one doesn‚Äôt come out in the next week or so.

Doesn‚Äôt work well with Amazon music app,"
  Does not work properly with amazon music. Slows down and speeds up randomly, mostly when switching apps. My other pair of wireless headphones still works fine with amazon music. So it must just be the AirPods. Works perfectly fine with Apple Music, no glitches, but I do not have the Apple Music subscription... so this is clearly a ploy by Apple to get people to solely use their music app. Pretty annoyed by it since I have the amazon music with my amazon prime subscription.

Not the newest Generation Airpots,"
  I purchased these during Prime days since they were advertised as the 2nd generation airpods with wireless charging case. Received on time and was pleased with the ease of connectivity and music playback as i worked outside. The main reason i purchased these was to be handsfree during my workday making and receiving calls. I immediately received feedback from the other party on calls that they couldn't hear me at all and that it was just static/ bad connection sounds when using the right airpod, left worked great. Needless to say that frustrated me consider the costs of these airpods. I reached out to apple support for advise and was sent to my local Best buy for repair/replacement of the right airpod. Best buy scanned the serial number on the box to order a replacement for me and informed me that these were in fact not 2nd generation airpods, that the model numbers listed on each one of them were 1st generation so that explains the issues I'm having. I feel i should be able to exchange these for 2nd generation airpods as that is what i purchased. Be mindful of the serial numbers listed on the actual airpods to confirm they are the second generation - First gen airpods serial numbers are : AirPods (1st generation)",2.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon Customer

  First, I am reviewing this based on price! It was advertised at $139. I was charged $199. The original in the post was $159 scratched out with the $139 below it. I would like my refund please! Also, K do not know how to wrk these. They fall out, hurt my ears, and only one of them work half of the time, also nothing happens when touching or tapping them. I cannot make anything happen by talking. I can get Siri to answer me after awhile of yelling at her, and that‚Äôs it. Other than that, I really don‚Äôt understand these things!

These have a specific place in daily life and exercise.,"
  Update:  So I still love these earbuds but they have a place.  Since I started using these I‚Äôve bought the AirPods Pro too and because of that and the use of Jabra Elite 65T Active I‚Äôve decided these have their own place.  So I live in an area with all 4 seasons.  So I run outside in the cold along with when it is warm.  Despite the fact that these are not rated as water or sweet resistant at all I decided to go ahead and try them.  For me these stay put really good in my ear (for running and normal use). They will not work well for functional training and will probably fall out.  Their sound quality compared to the Jabra and even better the AirPods Pro are much more flat.  Not much base at all in these.  So the place I‚Äôve decided to place these in my life.  If I‚Äôm in an atmosphere where I want to hear what is going on around me I still prefer these over the AirPods Pro which have the ‚Äútransparency mode‚Äù.  Also as I‚Äôm running outside I love the transparency mode on the AirPods Pro (AirPods Pro put their ‚Äúhear through‚Äù feature on the Jabra Elite 65 T to shame).  But that being said if I‚Äôm wearing a winter hat you can hear the hat rubbing on the mics on the AirPods Pro.  You don‚Äôt get that with these.  So I‚Äôll wear these while wearing a hat when running during colder weather and I‚Äôm still able to hear my surroundings without any distortion.  So for pairing, once paired these things are amazing.  I can walk around my entire house and not have any drops.  Now, Apple‚Äôs claim to fame is Airplay and the ability for you AirPods to switch seamlessly between Apple devices.  Well it doesn‚Äôt really work as seamless as they would like or we would like.  There are many times where I will switch to my Apple Watch to stream music to my AirPods and only one of the AirPods connect.  And something that has happened maybe twice they were not even recognizable.  The fix always seems to be just putting them back in the case, closing the lid, waiting a second or two and then it works.  It is just weird because there seems to be no reason to this problem.  It is completely random to even which single AirPod it connects to.  I haven‚Äôt removed a star for this fact because although annoying at times it still is a simple fix and a solid connection once they connect.  I hope this update helps.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Arron V

These were not new,"
  I purchased these as a gift for my daughters birthday. No where in the description of this product does it mention that these are REFURBISHED and NOT new as one would expect. When they arrived, the AirPods were packaged as if they came directly off the shelf at the Apple store. However, once I opened the package I noticed scratches on the case and dirt underneath the AirPods. Also, the clear sleeve that protects the charging case was tapped down giving the illusion they were NEW. I attempted to charge the AirPods but I could never get the right AirPod to 100%. Once connected to Bluetooth I attempted to adjust the settings but the settings never appeared. After doing additional research I notice the AirPods serial number on the case didn‚Äôt match the serial number on the box?? If Amazon is going to continue selling these they need to be very clear that these are indeed REFURBISHED and NOT new. I WILL BE RETURNING these to Amazon IMMEDIATELY. I would recommended purchasing Apple products directly from Apple.

Best out there,"
  I have been using various wireless & bluetooth products for a while.  I got these yesterday and they are amazing.  They automatically turn on the second you pull them out of the case.  By the time they are in your ear, they are connected to my iphone and are ready to use.  In my iphone, I can configure each ear to do a specific task right in the phone settings without any special software.  I doubletap my left ear and I activate siri and I can doubletap my right ear to play/pause whatever I am listening/watching.  I went on a walk and there was a light breeze.  I called someone on the phone to see how the noise cancellation was and they couldnt hear the wind.  They did hear a car go by but thats to be expected.  I cannot comment on battery life yet, but I can confirm the wireless charging case works with any Qi wireless charging pad.  The pad charges the case and the case charges the earbuds.  This means you can charge your earbuds just by having them in a charged case, no matter where you are.  Really cool.  I also want to mention that if the regular wired earpods fit your ears really good, these will also fit well.  From what I can tell, they are the same size, if not a hair larger but I cannot tell by looking at them.  They dont wiggle around in my ear and they don't feel loose.  I feel like I could easily go on a jog and they'd stay in.

4/5,"
  Let me start off by saying I do really enjoy these. It's the quality you can imagine from apple so no worries there, I just wish they would get a water proof set already. The noise cancellation isn't magnificent, but definitely average/decent I'd say. Overall I'd buy them again because it really is awesome to have a wireless set up, just be aware these things will eventually fully die after a year or two due to the hardware set up. (you cant replace internal batteries) but I'd still go for it if you want the airpods experience. Yeah sure, eventually water proof and such will be delivered but who knows when. I think these are worth it. I love the wireless charging case too.

Great AirPods,"
  I listen to books or music while I am hiking with my dogs and the headphone wires kept getting tangle with my dogs leash and the water bottle carrier that was around my shoulder. It was a big pain to have to keep adjusting everything. So I finally decided to invest in AirPods and am so glad I did. Not having wires hanging and tangling in the leash is such a treat. I was worried that they would fall out when I hike, but they stay in very well. I only use 1 AirPods as I like to have an ear free for safety reason. I bought the wireless charging case because I keep the AirPods in my car on the days I hike M-F and then take them out to charge on the weekend when I am not hiking. These are definitely worth the money. But if you don't need the wireless charging case, it is not necessary and you can save some money.

One buys these buds for other than full range head banging music.  I use them A LOT!,"
  These have even more distance from phone range than the previous model. The sound range is somewhere from high bass to high highs.  They are perfect for phone conversations as sound range is more towards voice than music.  Music does sound very clear, they just don't have a lot of bass.  The microphone is really good.  When I used to have conversations with my daughter, she used some sort of headset, not apple, and I often asked her ""what?""  I sent her these airpods, and I can hear her perfectly, even when I'm using my airpods at the same time.  My kitchen is about in the middle of a 1700 sq. ft. house, and I usually leave my phone on the island and can walk all around the house without having to carry or pocket the phone, and it seldom breaks up.  I love them.

Happy splurge purchase,"
  I am happy purchased them after reviewing products for weeks. Preferred these cuz if they are out of the case you can tone them up and find them, however if they are in the case you can‚Äôt. Battery life has been great for me, 3hrs for ears, 24hrs for case that recharges the ears. Noise canceling isn‚Äôt really a thing with these, I can still hear music in the gym if I have them in and don‚Äôt play music, but when music plays it blocks out noise well. The old apple style head phones used to hurt my ears, and these still do too, but a nifty trick is to put the opposite one in the ear upside down and they are much more comfortable for long term wear, but you can‚Äôt talk in them like that. I got a glow in the dark case with a key ring and I haven‚Äôt lost them since I bought them a couple months ago. I enjoy the wireless charging cuz I have two wireless charging pads in my house.

Received used AirPods with ear wax absolutely disgusting,"
  I have been a loyal Amazon customer for the past couple of years. My original Apple AirPods were mistakenly washed so I turned to Amazon to purchase a new set of AirPods. I was warned and told to purchase them directly from Apple but I was confident that I would be able to receive them same level of service. Fast forward about a week I received the notification that my AirPods were delivered and I was super excited. As a former Apple employee I would definitely say that I‚Äôm aware of what a fresh pair of AirPods should look like. Upon opening the box I noticed that the box was old and seemed used and didn‚Äôt have the original tight plastic seal. So I opened the box and the AirPod case was severely scratched and I automatically knew that these AirPods were used. I opened the case and noticed reddish ear wax on both AirPod buds which is absolutely disturbing and disgusting. I would‚Äôve  never never a million years that this could happen. If I could give a negative rating I would this has been a horrible experience and I would never recommend that anyone buy small personal electronics from Amazon again.

Great quality Apple product at Amazon price,"
  These AirPods are the latest model with wireless charging capabilities, making them the most convenient earbuds on the market, in my opinion. I purchased them to pair with my iPhone 8 and didn't even have to read the instructions, before the two were paired. Now when I open the case, I can see on my phone the battery status of the case as well as the AirPods. Super sleek styling, magnetic seating and closure makes these so slick to replace for charging. Now I want a cover to go around the case! Well worth the purchase, save some money buying from Amazon. My only complaint, no Apple sticker, but I've got others, so I'll be ok.

The impeccable Apple AirPods pairing feature & audio quality will help your smile.,"
  Are use mine with an Apple iPhone. These are exceptionally good. I bought some Aha silicon ear hooks. These AirPods 2 using the Aha ear hooks keep them in position & are great. Other reviewers have mentioned improvement of sound, I think the Aha ear hooks do not reduce these AirPods sounds, but I don‚Äôt notice any enhancements either. The Aha hooks do not interfere with functions such as stopping the sounds when removed from your ear. These AHA‚Äôs must be removed for charging. The removal/replacement takes about 5 minutes. These AirPods 2 pair with Siri such that they pause, resume play skip tracks & change volume. When listening to streaming music, currently using Amazon Unlimited, free for 3 months with purchase, I do not need to adjust any of the features referred other than saying 1) ‚ÄúAlexis‚Äù to have features supported by Amazon Music or 2) ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù. Uncertain as to selecting playlists, Artists or stations. Some luck so far but these requests have been hit or miss. Perhaps Apple streaming will be more compatible. The battery seems to last 4+ hours. The batteries fully recharge by placing them in their charging case for 15 minutes. These Apple products also allows for making phone calls from your contacts by verbal commands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,DES

These are awesome!!,"
  I‚Äôve held off on Apple‚Äôs ear buds for a while because hard plastic ones always hurt my ears. Ive been wanting some truly wireless earbuds for a while. I was planning on getting a new Apple watch to replace my 1st gen watch that was ready keel over and saw that the watch 5 would support these ear buds. I decided to give it a try. At first my ears ached a little but I made sure that they just rested in my ears versus cramming them in like you have too with silicone ones. I‚Äôve gotten used to them now and they have become a huge part of my day now. I wear them at work listening to audiobooks and music, at home when I‚Äôm doing drawing, crafting, or cleaning the house. Ive only come close to running them dry once at work. Normally, i take a break every couple hours and pop then in their case to charge out of habit. I come from using $30 earbuds for years so the sound quality of these is absolutely mind blowing. And they cancel out noises and distractions very well. Mine were brand new from Amazon directly and in original sealed packaging. So I didn't have the gross issues that another person had with being sold a used product for the price of a new one. Got to watch out for those vendors sometimes. üòï

  I love these so much! I love the fact that the case itself charges when you return them. When you lift the lid, it will tell the battery life on your phone of each piece as well as the case. These are super easy to set up on your phone. I love the fact that you can set it up on ""Find My Device"". My cat decided to knock mine off in the floor and I was able to find them with the beeping/ringing sound it makes when you activate on your phone to find it. It makes it easy to answer calls when you don't have your phone on you, switch songs, as well as using SIRI. It is by far the best earbuds I've owned. I highly recommend.

  Bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. She takes them to the gym, to work out around the neighborhood on her runs, and when she's cleaning around the house. Only complaints I hear from her is that sometimes, the headphones will just randomly connect to her iPhone OR only one headphone will connect while the other stays silent. She just disconnects and reconnects them to resolve this issue; apparently it is an issue a lot of people have but work through. Would buy again.

Made for Apple Products,"
  This is my second pair of airpods. The first time around I had them paired with an apple device, needless to say they were flawless. Aside from the fit they were good, I'm no audiophile so the sound quality was great. My second pair I had paired With a Note 9 and after experiencing this you cant truly enjoy them. Many features lack such as in ear detection, the ability to chaged the tap features on the buds and the volume themselves. With my note 9 I would have issues of the volume of the buds lowering. And I don't mean my phone volume, I mean the actual buds volume. I didn't even know that the buds had a separate volume level, do they? To conclusion. If you have anything other than an iPhone then you should look elsewhere.

Double tap function doesn't work well with youtube,"
  I love the sound quality and the ease of setting these up. They don't feel like anything in my ears, but are stable enough that I don't have to worry about them falling out if I'm working out! The wireless charging is great and they can be worn one at a time so I can charge one while wearing the other. I can hear what's going on around me while they're on. For me, I love it! There are very inexpensive silicone tips available to aid in noise cancelation, if that's not your thing. Also, when I wear hearing protection (ear plugs) I have to use 2 different sizes, because one ear is larger than the other. These fit both my ears equally well. Extremely comfortable. I can hardly feel I'm wearing them.",4.0 out of 5 stars,Kim

Do no buy these from here.,"
  After just two months my left ear bud stopped working.  I find out that they are probably refurbished and not new.  After spending an hour on the phone with amazon customer support and apple support I have to go into the store to possibly get a new pair of REFURBISHED pods.  It is DISGUSTING that you pay full price and after 2 months all you get are a used pair.  I stayed away from APPLE for years and just recently went with them with a XS max phone.  I wish i had just stayed with my android.  APPLE is a big company who does not care about you or your hard earned money.  Amazon is disappointed that the description does not even say refurbished.

AMAZON PRIME  IS AMAZING,"
  Every once in a while you get a product that just does not work like it is suppose to work. This was, if you will excuse the pun...a bad APPLE. I went to the return place on the initial order and touched on maybe 3 issues  to describe the problem. This was Monday night about 8:45PM. Amazon Prime, in its' infinite striving to be the best in the industry, sent a label for the return and every direction I could possibly need to make this a completely seamless transaction. This was a Gift for our Granddaughters 13th Birthday and I felt terrible that it didi not work, but in less than 12 hours a box with Brand New AirPods was on my porch . When I picked up my granddaughter from school and the box with her new AirPods was sitting in her seat she smiled so big I think I could hear her happiness. That was more than worth the price. Thank you Amazon for making this brand new teenager so very happy. You're the BEST.

Should not have waited so long,"
  I was a hold out on the AirPods, but after my kids each got a pair and told me how much they love them I had to get some. They are well worth the money. Easiest set up ever. Open the case and hold next to the phone and you are set to go. They fit just like the wired apple earbuds, but no wires.  I have also noticed that when I open the Amazon app when I am listening to apple music it temporarily pauses the music on my phone.  I do not have Amazon music so I am not sure if that works with AirPods or not, but I am going to go with what other reviews say and go with NO so if you  listen to Amazon music you will have to make a different choice when using AirPods.  I do have small ears and losing these was a fear of mine, since the regular ear buds fall out, so I did purchase the silicone cover with the ear hook and that was a smart choice.  I have never felt like these will fall out with the silicone.  I also purchased a protective case to keep the wireless charging case from getting scratched.

"Great sound quality on calls, great battery life","
  I take calls nearly every day, in a context where exceptional sound quality really matters, and I spend a great deal of time on most calls, so I've tried literally dozens of products for a comfortable, hands-free experience that allows me to focus on the interactions - not stuck dealing with technology.  I've tried the best and the most expensive products around.  Better than almost all *wired* products (but wired is so problematic at times - thus all the experimenting with wireless options).  I spent hundreds of dollars on one popular product (begins with a B), alone.  From the start, I couldn't use that set for calls due to callers' complaints about the sound.  I use it for music and for noise canceling when yard workers are out with their loud equipment, but I don't use it for calls - ever.  My Air pods are by far the best.  Everyone I've asked, and who knows the difference from calling me over the years, agrees.  Oh, also, Google Maps has no problem taking addresses by voice using an Air pod (one piece for driving; it's the law), whereas my tranyas made voice address navigating impossible.  I'd have to unpair them, then use speaker to give Google Maps the address, then pair them (well, it - the one piece while driving) again.  Not with air pods.  They get it right every time.  The air pods are also comfortable for hours , and stay in well with normal use (they're even ok for side sleeping; rarely, one will fall out overnight).

Great audio quality from a name you know,"
  One of the things I've always liked about the Apple earbuds is that they deliver pretty decent low end frequencies.  A lot of the other branded earbuds didn't really seem to satisfy this request.  I listen to all kinds of music - alternative, metal, rap, country, and even classical.  Having earbuds that provide a fuller range are a necessity.  The wired ones fit the bill there - so how well do the wireless ones hold up?  Excellently.  I've not really heard any degradation of audio going to the Airpods.",5.0 out of 5 stars,A. Beach

I finally decided to treat myself for my birthday,"
  I always thought that these were too expensive and I couldn't justify spending that much money on earbuds.  I have used the wired version in the past when they come with a new phone but that seems like a thing of the past.  I have a pair of Soundcore wireless earbuds with charging case that I spent $100 on and they are very nice and comparable to the Apple version.  However, the problem with the Soundcore earbuds is that they are very sensitive and the slightest adjustment in your ear causes them to skip songs or pause songs etc.  They also use those rubber end caps that never really seem to sit quite right in my ear and if I'm moving around they tend to fall out.  The Apple airpods fit perfectly and stay put in my ear without me worrying if they are going to fall out.  I'm glad I spent the money and wish I had done it a long time ago!

These are Gen 2 Air Pods,"
  These are Gen 2 Air Pods in a wireless charging capable case just as they are being represented. I ran the model numbers from the sealed package from Apple thru the Apple.com support site and they are Gen 2. Ordered at 4PM and they were delivered before 8AM the next day. They perform just as all the reviews say they do - excellent in my opinion. I don't like the ear-insertion tips of the Air Pod Pro model so these are excellent for me. They pair instantly with an iPhone which also automatically pairs them with all other Apple devices in your iCloud account. I also paired them with my Windows based HP PC. Had to turn bluetooth off and back on, on the PC and have my iPhone off to get them to pair but they did and the sound  quality with YouTube and other programs is perfect. I will by the aftermarket wireless charger shown on the Amazon page with these. Apple's price is ridiculous  Even these were cheaper thru Amazon than direct from Apple.

Apple got me to drop $150 for headphones and I don't regret it,"
  So I was against these from day 1.  Why would I spend 150+ dollars for a pair of headphones that seem to be the same as the free ones that come with my phone. Plus apple removed the hedphone jack which is about the most lowball thing they could do.  But after spending a few days with these, I see why everyone got them.  They know when they are in or out of your ear and turn on and off.  The wireless changing case always is amazing.  I don't have to make sure I have a powerbank or cords with me.  It will just charge, the sound is great and speaking is clear. Overall I would recommend. The battery life is about 5 hours but just 15min of charging adds on a few hours.  So charges fast.  I am still angry at the headphone jack though.  -100 stars to apple for that!

"Defective, but definitely legit product","
  These were fantastic - for the first fifteen minutes. Shortly into use, the left pod stopped working. I assumed they were dead, so I placed them on my charging pad to charge. After about an hour, I removed them from the case and tried to use them again. The left one was still unresponsive. Following some tips from the Apple website, I attempted to reset them, but this seems to have screwed up the entire system. Now, they only show a blinking white light and will not pair with any of my devices, Apple or otherwise. I know these are legitimate AirPods because, after reading some reviews, I did a deep dive into the Internet to see if maybe they were fake, but I confirmed that these were indeed the real deal. They sounded great and were so user friendly right up until they stopped working, so I‚Äôm going to try again. Just in case, though, I am going to pay the extra $15 and buy them directly from the Apple website. I have since returned these defective earphones.

Easy to lose and no trade in for the pro-version,"
  Bought these September 30, lost the left one within 2 weeks, paid $75ish direct to Apple to get a new left one, and Apple announced the Pro version a few days later.  The Reviews on the pro version indicate a better ear fit that would reduce my chances of losing another one and indicate a better sound quality. The generation 2 that I bought are fine in general,  but I am frustrated how easy they are to lose / fall out. I am also frustrated that Apple does not have an trade in type program to allow me to pay Apple even more to get the pro version, but to not have to spend another $250 this month on top of the $250 that I spent last month ($175ish for the gen 2 + $75 for the left replacement within 2 weeks). I also have an annoying pair of wireless beats headphones I bought from Apple a couple years ago. My take away for this review... don‚Äôt trust that since it is Apple it must be good / they will work with you and please shop smarter than I have.

Apple Quality Abound,"
  I was converted to Apple products in 2010 and have found over the years that their product just work. No matter the application or device. You can expect all the same with these AirPods. Wish they figured out volume control without grabbing phone, tablet or laptop to make the adjustment. Fit leaves room for improvement so if you have hard to fit ear canals spend the extra money on the AirPod Pro model that just came out. I'm kicking myself for buying these not realizing they were going to launch the Pro model this month. GRrrrrr!! Another issue I don't like is they block sound from the room I'm in so if someone tries to talk to you it is difficult to hear them. I guess that is good if you don't want to hear them! LOL At the end of the day I would recommend these for the budget conscience buyer who can't justify the Pro version. They easily pair to all my devices and the voice quality on calls is terrific as well. There are other features to discover as you get familiar using them. I'll let you discover them for yourself!

"Nice-to-have, but Has Its Issues","
  I've wanted Apple AirPods for some time now, and I finally decided to pull the trigger. Overall, I've been pleased with the experience. The best part of these headphones are that they are wireless and it's really nice to talk on the phone without having to carry the phone with you. I do have a few gripes though that have made it almost more of a pain than it has been a godsend. The first is that the battery life isn't great. The second is that it has a habit of connecting and disconnecting often which can be a real pain when trying to talk to someone and it changes from phone, to AirPods, to speaker, etc. Sometimes this issue occurs when taking out an ear piece and then reinserting it. It does not always reconnect. The final issue is that the plastic of the case itself is surprisingly not good. It scratches so easily. This I was surprised about since Apple prides itself with its quality. I was disappointed with the quality of the case.

Happy with the AirPods,"
  Like all things Apple, these have made my life easier. No more walking with my phone plugged in and having the ear pods come out when I turn my head or the cord gets caught in my purse. I was worried they wouldn‚Äôt stay in my ears, but they do.  I have trouble with my left ear staying in on the corded ones, so I am happy I don‚Äôt have the same problem with the AirPods. They give me freedom to talk without interrupting me if I‚Äôm cooking, baking or cleaning. They work well with my iMac, so I can take my Spanish lessons with my tutor over Skype and he hears me much clearer than when I didn‚Äôt use them.

Good for casual listening,"
  The AirPods are good. They are very convenient. They are great for wearing around the office, and they are also great for college students. But they don‚Äôt have the greatest sound quality, and they do you not do a good job of noise canceling. I also have Powerbeats and the sound quality is far better on the Powerbeats than the AirPods. I did purchase the wirelessly charging case, so it is super convenient to charge the AirPods. One thing that is pretty great about AirPods is that the case that you carry them in also charges them. So even though you only have a five hour charge for a full charge on the AirPods, you still have a 24 hour charge left on your charging case if it‚Äôs fully charged. So you are going to have plenty of charge. Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for great sound quality or something to use while you‚Äôre Running or exercising then I would consider looking at other options. But if you just want something casual to just walk around or wear around the office, the AirPods are a good way to go because they are not very showy and they‚Äôre super easy to carry around.

I question its genuineness after a year of usage,"
  I purchased the AirPod like a year ago because it was on a deal at that time($169 compared to $199 in apple). I am a huge apple fan and I have never purchased apple from a third party seller. But since I am a prime member I took a shot that time. It worked very well, came brand new with sealed package and appeared what was expected but now I am having a lot of problem with this product. First the left pod lost some volume and then the right. I have not had any issue with the battery or connectivity yet but one of my friend who purchased his AirPod with me on the same deal says his battery started dying out after few months use. He ended up buying the AirPod pro from the Apple store after that. It has led me to the conclusion that apple‚Äôs genuineness only comes from their genuine apple store. I suggest you to purchase apple products only from apple website or apple store.

Definitely get these, even if your coworkers aren‚Äôt annoying and even if you don‚Äôt have an iPhone! Music, movies, books, podcasts or whatever! These are the best!

"So Easy, Gret Design","
  I love that all I did was open them up once out of the box and they were connected. The connection is stronger than all the less expensive earbuds I was constantly buying that cut out and got choppy all the time. I‚Äôve gotten really far from my phone and haven‚Äôt lost the signal. I like that they stop playing the second I remove it from my ear and connect as soon as they are in my ears. The programming of the double tap is also convenient. The only downside is I wish they lasted a full 8 hours on one charge, but I can only use one at a time at my job anyway so I just switch ears. The case lasts through a few charges too. I feel like I spent my money well. Apple is pricey, but always worth it for me.

Battery life is not what Apple claims,"
  This is a great product, sound quality fantastic, I especially like the control function by tapping the top of the air pods. I also like the case, you can charge that separately and then charge the air pods in the case as well.  I do not like the battery capacity. Every time I start using them for a run or a walk, batteries start to die, they don‚Äôt last more than 5 hours.

"First gen Airpods, good if you hate wires","
  First, these arrived new and connected right to my phone which was a plus. They are literally the regular headphones but without wires. If you turn music up the noise cancels but otherwise no special features. Also for some reason when I go running they fly out my ears, so wouldn‚Äôt recommend for rigorous activities.. if it could just be my ears. And they say they‚Äôre not waterproof but I dropped them in water and put them in rice & they worked soo lol. One last thing, the whole wireless charging case is just the case being charged & you can charge your airpods in that case off the charger.

"Good sound, interfaces easily with iPhone","
  I bought this for my college-age son and he loves it.  I had previously purchased other brands for him and they did not interface well with his iPhone.  No problem with that here, obviously.  Also the first wireless ones he's had, which was key.  He uses it every day to make phone calls and listen to music as he works out.  He is very happy with the sound quality.  Battery life is not an issue, he says it recharges quickly.  It will be interesting to see how they hold up.  For this price, I expect not to have to replace them annually.  We will see.

They fell out,"
  I was looking for wireless headphones for the gym and to wear at work as I do construction. I ordered these because they seem like the best choice for an IPhone and everyone I know was saying how they don‚Äôt fall out. But I guess my ears are not normal because as soon as I got on the treadmill they bounced out of my ears onto the treadmill belt and shot across the floor of the gym. How embarrassing and disappointing. They would be fine if I sat on my butt all day doing office work or something but they just don‚Äôt work for my active lifestyle. As for sound quality and battery life those are both good but don‚Äôt expect any noise cancellation. And don‚Äôt expect to buy those add on things that add size to the buds to keep them in the ear because those don‚Äôt fit in the case. Pretty disappointed in these but I should have known better

Very nice. Buy a case though,"
  These things are great for the average music listener. As a college student, these are a good investment, and will greatly help you out. I do not listen to music through headphones very often. But when I do, say after a class on the way to my car, they are great little headphones. I rarely have to charge them, maybe once or twice a week. Speaking of charging, the wireless charging feature with this model is awesome. Just set it down in the pad and it starts to charge! However, the one con with these headphones is the glossy white plastic they used. If you are OCD as I am, you are going to be annoyed at how easily the plastic scratches and scuffs. A cheap rubber case with a carabiner  is a good investment to help protect the case, while also covering the already present scratches. The best thing about these headphones is the W1 chip also preset in the Beats X wireless headphones. For iPhone users, this makes pairing and connecting effortless.

Loud sub bass pop in voices and constant amplifier hiss,"
  I have hearing a little different than most people I guess.  There is a old school transistor like hiss even when listening to nothing.  The hiss is something I have not heard since most new devices have mosfet based systems.  When listening to youtube videos or any video that someone talks directly into a mic the airpods produce a loud ""pop"" of very low frequency.  Think of listening to talk radio on a 12"" sub woofer.  The audio is clear but not refined enough for the huge price tag.  It's also a pain to get the airpods out of the case.

Great headphones,"
  I've been searching for a decent set of headphones for a while, but didn't want to shell out the money. After trying a few different types, I finally bit the bullet and ordered the AirPods and soon wished I'd done it sooner. They were so nice that I bought my mother a pair for Christmas. She's not very tech savvy and finds them very easy to use. I wear one headphone at work at a time and listen to podcasts during the day. I usually get about 4-5 hours on a charge. The case seems to hold enough juice to charge the Pods quite a few times. I only end up having to charge the case once a week and use the pods 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Plus a little here and there when talking on the phone and driving.

Absolute Game Changer at work,"

NO MORE! I'm not sure if it's active pass through or passive but I am able to carry on conversations with people in the office and of course over the phone with absolutely no issues at reasonable music volumes. I wear these for 10 hours a day on work days with an on ear headset and have no issues with discomfort. They last about 6 hours without charging with volume at about 20% so as long as I put them in the case for 5 or 10 minutes during breaks I they never die while I'm working.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Zachary
Time wasting,"
  I had first generation AirPods from the beginning but always had trouble with one or the other not connecting or going to use them and finding one dead and not charging. I finally got sick of wasting time taking one in and out of the case 20 times trying to get whichever one to charge and eating up all my running time like this so I ordered this new pair. First time worked like a dream, when they work they work great. Second time, today, I opened the fully charged case to find right one charged 100% and the left one at 1%, and it‚Äôs exactly what was happening with my old pair. I am beyond frustrated and have now lost my run time today starting and restarting and pulling the left one in and out until it would charge. Still waiting for the p r to charge. This is beyond frustrating and disappointing, Apple should do better!

  Guys, pls start checking your AirPods for Serial# and model# !!!!  I bought three of these airpod in July 2019. I picked one for my own and others for my parents. I first belived it came direct from apple store, so I ignored every small details that tells me these are not new AirPods. My left airpod is very hard to do two-tap register in first week. I tolerated. And around Jan 2020, it stopped two-tap completely. So I checked the model#. The case is generation2 early edition, left ear is A2031 and right ear is A2032?! My iPhone tells me it's A2031. So it is definitely a A2031 set paired with a A2032 right earplug. No where to fix or return but to purchase a replacement from apple. So, the decision is yours.

  I am happy with the AirPods. They are light in the ear; I went to put the right one in the left ear by mistake, but the left one was already in. I like that I don't drag my phone off the desk when I get up. The charge may last for only 3 hours or so, but the case will charge them completely in 15 minutes; and if you charge one at a time, you still have listening pleasure. The sound is great. I realized I couldn't turn them up manually, but if you ask, Siri will do it for you. I like that the serial number is under the lid, I guess if I lose them. I even bought a cover for fun and strap to use while exercising.

Great for my purse! Great companion for everyday use at work and for running errands!,"
  I opted for these instead of the pros since these are my ‚Äúpurse headphones‚Äù. I mainly keep one earbud in my ear while working, listening to podcasts/videos. The battery life isn‚Äôt amazing, but that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so great about the charging case. When one bud dies after five hours of continuous use, I just switch out for the opposite bud. The case charges quickly and I‚Äôm able to get a full day of work in as well as running errands without distraction. They are slim and less noticeable than other wireless earbuds, so for the price, I‚Äôll take theIr stealthy appearance and their ability to connect to my other Apple products seamlessly. I also am impressed with the fit and how well they sound, compared to in ear buds I have owned in the past. I enjoyed the feel of the second generation Apple earbuds that have come with the iPhone, so without struggling with wires, I am extremely pleased that I spent the extra 100$ on accessories for my iPhone. I got a cute case for the AirPods, a new phone case, and a wireless charging station for under $60. Worth every penny. I even find myself using them frequently at home, especially while I‚Äôm cooking or playing on my computer. I keep one ear bud out to hear my partner or my surroundings while still listening to music or videos. I recommend these for your bag, especially if you don‚Äôt wish to carry your nice over the ear noise canceling headphones, like I do for everyday use in public/at work.

  Almost a year later and they are still a daily staple. It‚Äôs so nice to have a headset that can seamlessly swap between my phone, iPad, and MacBook as needed. And now, with COVID, if I‚Äôm out, I can use Siri for hands free phone use to keep my phone away from germs. Battery life is great to me: the AirPods and the charging case. And getting the wireless charging case is worth it since I have a wireless charger by my bed. They take NO TIME to charge up and the case will last days or weeks depending on how often I use them. Sure, I‚Äôd love the Pros, but these do just fine - especially if you can‚Äôt splurge that much. I really don‚Äôt struggle with them falling out of my ears or getting uncomfortable. In fact, I‚Äôll forget I have them in sometimes. I strongly suggest getting a case so you can attach them somewhere. I keep them hooked on my wallet, so they are always with me when I need them.

Great Purchase,"
  I always get nervous ordering Apple products, but I had just had a friend let me borrow these and I knew I had to have them.  I think the wireless charging case, if you listen to music/podcasts/etc. frequently, are worth the extra price.  It's nice to just have one headphone in, while the other one charges.  When you have both headphones in and you take one out of your ear, whatever you are listening to will automatically pause.  I didn't think I would like them as much as I do, but they have come in handy when I am at work and just want to listen to something discreetly, while working on my computer.  If you have had any doubts with purchasing these, don't.  I was just as skeptical and I double-checked serial numbers and everything.  They are the real Apple product and have far exceeded my expectations.

Money wasted,"
  I have ordered these twice. I had to send back the first set because they didn‚Äôt hold a charge. Now the 2nd set won‚Äôt hold a charge. I have had them for a little longer than a month and the return window has closed. These were supposed to be new, but performance makes me feel I received refurbished ones. I am very disappointed with this purchase and likely won‚Äôt use Amazon for electronics based on this purchase.

"Great if you are an Apple nut, otherwise go with something else","
  My son loves them personally I think you are better off with a number of different products but you gotta love the Apple marketing machine.  Personally I would go with the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro's or the original Samsung Galaxy Buds not the Plus, they are terrible.  I also hear good things about the Jabra 75T or the Sony Wm 100MX3 I think but I have not tried the Jabra or the Sony.

Love them.,"
  I love my AirPods. I wear them on a daily basis and have held up against some pretty nasty falls. I once dropped them in a puddle and thought for sure all Hope was lost, but nope! They continue to work beautifully. The sound quality is superb and I appreciate being able to hear the world around me with them in. Not noise cancelling by any means, but that is not what I was looking for. Battery life is great with this case. I charge mine once every few days with daily use.

"Defective, lied to by Apple regarding warranty, no resolution.","
  Mine had defective batteries in the right airpod from the start. The wireless case would also randomly go from half charged to totally dead, and would then drain both airpods completely dead in the case. I contacted Apple, and they couldn‚Äôt do anything since they had closed all their stores due to COVID-19, but they assured me that once the stores opened up they would make it right. Once they reopened, it was then past the warranty period, and they told me to get lost. This is the purchase that turned me from  continuous iPhone user since they first came out into someone shopping for Android products. Buy something else.

Totally worth it. Just be prepared to switch for the few times it goes mute.,"
  I like thst it's wireless however there were times when in the middle of a conversation, it would automatically go mute. And this is only after 5 minutes into the conversation over thr phone. Got nothin to do with the signal or carrier. Never happened b4 until I started using the airpods. All in all, it serves the purpose- but totally much better reception than the cheap immitations out there. Fits in my ears pretty well- better than the wired ones.

Traded Up to These for my iPhone,"
  These have great sound and are true Apple product. I guess they were a great price because I see the newest model (December 2020) has a rubber piece at the end that probably holds them in your ear better. I take long walks with them daily and they stay in fine. I would not recommend this model if you were going to exercise with them on as they would quickly fall out. Work great for my purposes.

AIRPODS ARE AMAZING!!!,"
  I LOVE THEM!!!! I got my Airpods this summer (during Prime day) and they are the best thing I've ever purchased. I'm actually mad at myself for not getting them sooner. I had wireless Beats, which were alright for listening to music, but they were way too bulky and didn't take calls the way Airpods do. I'm an Apple person, so I absolutely love how they switch from my phone to my Mac and iPad. If you're considering getting them - DO IT!!! They are absolutely amazing!!!

Great wireless earbuds,"
  This is an apple product.  It is solid and works seamlessly.  Of course it is priced higher than others because it is a high-end product.  You don't expect Whole Foods quality from Aldi's produce section, do you?  You get what you pay for.  Bite the bullet and get these wireless earbuds.  They will last you a long time and connecting takes seconds.  They actually drown out the background noise fairly well and battery lasts longer than I thought.

Great,"
  My only drawback is the battery life of the AirPods and not the case. The pods themselves seem to run battery life pretty fast but the case not so much. But charging them is pretty fast. I honestly love them, they fit perfectly in my ears and sound quality is great. But my husband doesn‚Äôt like the way they fit comfortably in his ears, maybe they could come up with some plastic covers for ppl with sensitive skin because hi ears at sensitive to them sometimes but other than that he likes them as well

Good sound quality,"
  I bought these to replace a wireless Bose headset. The sound quality is good. The carry/wireless charging case is awesome and super convenient, though I don‚Äôt charge it wirelessly. The small size is perfect for carrying around anywhere. It fits in your pocket or purse, and is not too big to attach to your keys with a separate case. The noise cancellation is good, but not as good as the Bose headset I‚Äôm replacing. The buds stay in pretty well. I love that you can wear just one or both and the sound adjusts itself. I‚Äôm pretty happy with it so far.

  I opted for these rather than the ""Pro's"" as I do not like things stuck into my ear canal. I also was not concerned with noise cancellation. I have nice over ear models for that when I travel.

Great!,"
  After comparing these to Gen 1, I can say that the sound quality is a little better, and the tap feature does operate better than Gen 1. Apple makes thing simple, which is why I like them and to why I like the AirPods. I like how easy you can connect them, the music pauses after taking one out, and light they are. I also like how you are able to purchase accessories for them, so if you want the isolation feature then you could purchase buds to isolate the sound. However, the only down fall of that option is it doesn‚Äôt let you charge with the buds on. Anyways, in my opinion AirPods have been the better earbuds I have owned.

I‚Äôm not sure what took me so long to make the change.  The sound is clear, it‚Äôs convenient, and portable. I like that my case is rechargeable. My only issue is that sometimes the right AirPod pops out without notice. I‚Äôve had to replace one already. Other thank that, these are a winner for me.

Great buds,"
  Setup was a dream! Just open the lid next to your phone and it prompts you to connect! I bought them to wear for traveling. You can still hear the pilot come over the speaker to tell you the weather when you‚Äôre 20 minutes away from your destination so they don‚Äôtc completely block the sound. Some may argue that‚Äôsa good thing. It would be nice if they had a little more bass to them but all in all they are a really good set. The best thing is how little I have to charge them. The battery life is outstanding!!!

"Small improvements, but great ones nonetheless","
  I decided to get this after losing my first-gen AirPods, thinking the wireless charging case would be a nice upgrade and the AirPods Pro hasn‚Äôt seen price cuts steep enough. Connecting them with my iPhone is noticeably faster than my older pods, but pairing them with older devices that rely on older Bluetooth standards is still quite a challenge with spotty first connects, if a bit better. The hinge is now finished in a brushed instead of a mirror finish, which should hold up better against scratches. No surprises in the fit, they fit my ears quite well and stayed inside my ears during runs, although sometimes they feel loose during more vigorous steps. Hey Siri works most of the time, but the sound quality of Siri is now miles better than before. The wireless charging case definitely adds noticeable heft and bulk, although the AirPods are still quite the featherweight, they now just fit more snugly in my jeans‚Äô coin pocket

  I have always hated the wired ear buds and don't prefer to use over-the-ear earphones while I'm at work but these are absolutely perfect as no one notices that I'm wearing them and I can take calls hands free while I'm still producing designs or signage and don't have to stop. I mainly use these while I work and they usually last me all day, I will normally only use 1 at a time just in case someone pops into my office I will still be able to hear them as well.

Apple Ear Pods with Wireless Charging Case,"

So I purchased the SOFT CONNECT - by Comply - SOFT FOAM TIPS for Apple Air Pods Gen. 1 & 2.  AND, after reading one of the reviews, purchased the SMALL tips, because I have a small ear canal.

  At first I loved my AirPods. In fact I loved them so much I even broke down and bought a second pair after flushing my first down the toilet-case  and all!  But after a few months only the right one will work consistently. I‚Äôve unpaired and paired them more times than I can count. Sometimes that will make both work again, but only for one use. I‚Äôve cleaned them. I‚Äôve checked connections and both are charging. For how much I paid I was hoping they would work longer than a few months.

  I replaced my Galaxy Buds with these after being annoyed by the fit, which I found uncomfortable. My AirPods have since been incredibly comfortable to wear. AirPods have been incredibly convenient. They are easy to pair, simple to move between multiple devices (especially between various Apple devices) and have great sound quality. The battery generally gets me through a week before needing a charge on my usage, although if I have a high-use day, they may only last me two days. It would be nice if they could work better with Android phones and Windows laptops, but they are still great earbuds for these devices. Highly recommend!

  I love everything about these AirPods.

  Sound quality feeling pretty same as standard headphones coming with iphone. Mostly I use airpods with MacBook(2019) and iphone. It works mostly well with iPhone but not with MacBook. When airpods connect to laptop and enable microphone(in this mode sound quality is very bad), I need each time to switch microphone to macbook built-in. But this is not the biggest issue. Macbook in 30% fails to connect to airpods. iTunes show playing music but I don't hear anything. Also iTunes throwing error with some codes(haven't check) and disconnect airpods. After putting airpods to case and disconnecting them from laptop then can work again. If you want to use headphones with macbook then better not to buy wireless.

  I had the first gen AirPods and they were stolen. I bought the newest one and the upgrades are amazing! I can control my music with just my voice! Turn the volume up or down, skip songs, play playlists, basically everything Siri can do without even having to tap my AirPod to invoke Siri. The sound quality is clear and crisp and phone calls are crystal clear for both ends.

  I love my AirPods. I mean, think everyone does lol. Gone are the days of the wire blocking the way of the workout or just life. I‚Äôve always wanted something with this concept and I‚Äôm glad that I was able to get these in particular. I love how I can also use the Find My Phone app on my phone to find them in my bed when I fall asleep with them in my ear. 5 stars all around.

"A good blue tooth earphone sets but it comes in 3 pieces, Lose one you have to replace the set!","
  good bluetooth sound and fits nicely in ear. One size fits all nothing to get stuck in the ear canal you have to fish out. However it is a three piece unit - left ear, right ear, charging unit. Nothing connecting the two ear pieces so it is all too easy to lose one ear piece then the whole does not work. I'm going back to a unit that holds the plugs together as I lost one of the plugs. they're rather expensive to replace.

AirPods works for me.,"
  The Apple AirPods it‚Äôs a great product the only problem I have with it is that it does not cancel out the noise in the background so you cannot use it if you are taking care of business. I use another product to help the AirPod stay in my ears when I am at the gym or running. The clarity is fantastic the sound quality when I‚Äôm listening to my music is fantastic.  This product works for me. Let‚Äôs your decision be your guide.

  Horrible I was on a very important phone call when the battery died and ended my phone call. I was so disappointed, it doesn't keep changing.

2/5 Going to Update Though,"
  I got this about a month ago and on the second day of receiving them the music started cutting out and disconnecting from my phone. I thought it was just my phone so I disconnected it and repaired it again, but the problem kept persisting. The beat and sound are pretty good in my opinion and there is a little bit of noise cancelling but not that much since these are not the pros. I am going to update my review when I receive my new pair in a few days but for now I am rating them 2/5. The return is very easy and when I called up apple they made it sound like so much more work. I really like that I can go to my local Kohls to return them, with Amazon instead of having that whole process with Amazonüëçüèº.

Cool Headset Device!,"
  No more wire tangle mess to deal with.  Makes listening to music when going to the gym or for a run easier.  Love the auto-detect and auto-connect too iPhone feature.  In the Bluetooth settings, you can set what double-tap does when you double-tap the left or right airpod (e.g. Siri, Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track, or Off).  Only wished there was feature you can set volume, but I just have to do it by hand or have Siri do it, but Siri tends to increase/decrease in increments of 2 I think.  Opening your Airpod case will display the battery life on your iPhone or you can set it as a widget in Batteries.  Overall I love them!

  I order new AirPods and got used defective AirPods. When package arrived it was placed in old opened bubble wrapping not in the traditional Apple packaging the cord was placed in the box in a circular direction with the AirPods sitting in the middle. It was obvious they were used. In trying to pair them they would not pair completely. Prior to trying the option to reset, a message came up ‚Äúnot your AirPods‚Äù üò≥.

  Left AirPod did not charge correctly right out of the box. I could charge the entire thing overnight, and it was always percentages behind and then maybe caught up, and maybe didn‚Äôt after charging off of the wireless case. This was very inconvenient, and resulted in them dying on me a couple of times. Cool concept but if it doesn‚Äôt work, it doesn‚Äôt matter.

Spotty Bluetooth,"
  I do not know whether its because I used it in University, because I have an android phone, or because I might have gotten a broken unit. Either way the connection was terrible. The moment I put my phone in my pocket the sound would go out or become magnitudes worse.  I ended up returning it but when it did work, mostly in my tiny apartment, it was really cool lasted a while and sounded alright. Either way not being able to take earbuds outside is kind of a deal breaker.

  AirPod set up and use is predictably easy as the name brand Apple product.  Warning tone is issued on a low battery. Peering is extremely easy. There are a number of third-party cases.

  If you commute every day, headphones are an essential. I have the beats studio headphones as well which work great to cover my ear during winter like earmuffs, but these 90+ degree days in the city make me super happy I made this purchase. Also, with the beats they pick up sound when I‚Äôm on a call. These AirPods do not and other people hear me crystal clear and not background noise as much. They don‚Äôt feel like they will fall out like I thought and also don‚Äôt have to spend 5 minutes untangling the cord on the old ones. No buttons to push they know when to turn off and on on their own! To see the battery percentage just lift the lid near your iPhone and it pops right up.

Tougth was because my iphone Xs max software was not updated, so I download latest ios version, try to look online for a way to reset o fix de problem. Nothing worked. I thought about keeping them since everything else seems to work ok, but if you spend more than a $100 in something supposedly high quality, and my old, cheap, non recognized brand earbuds did work better than these ""apple airpods.

  Sound quality is good for not being over the ear headphones. It‚Äôs very loud and battery lasts for about 3 to 4 hours. Easy to control and connects fairly quickly if you‚Äôre using an iPhone.

  i purchased these for my 11 year old son. I was wondering how he would do taking these pods in and out of that small case. He has done well with them .  These pods are magnetic and when you open the case and go to put them in the specific spot they go into it sort of grabs them with the magnet ..this has helped him never drop them. we also got the clear case holder cover..its nice to have . great product.

Verified Authentic! Great!,"
  Great purchase!!! Glad I got to save money with them being on sale. There are the real thing. Mine came fully sealed in plastic wrap and I verified my serial # with Apple right away. Super happy! Just make sure you‚Äôre purchasing as ‚ÄúSold by Amazon‚Äù to ensure it‚Äôs not coming from a third party seller.

Good after sync !!,"
  Had some sync issues in the beginning, I was not able to figure out what was happening, but after a quick google search and and good reset of the air pods it started to work. Once it syncs properly with the phone I have had no issues.

LEGIT,"
  Models numbers match up, brand new in the box 100% legit and work great, get up around 120 ft away without something blocking signal hooks up instantly and flawlessly.  I would recommend to anyone who doesn't already have the first model.

"Happy Wife, Happy Life","
  Ordered this because my teenage daughter has a pair, my wife has an android and these can be connected to her phone. I even found an app to pop up on her screen when she open the case like on the iphone. My wife loves them. I might get me a pair.

"Good fit, light and good mic and headphone quality","
  Excellent form factor and good fit. The pairing process is oversimplified and pairing those with multiple device is possible. You still have to select the AirPods from the device whenever you want to use them. Automatically detects if you are using a single one or both. The sound quality is good, apparently especially the mic, people said the sound is much better. I have experienced some drops from time to time, it turned out I had too many bluetooth devices connected at the same time. Now, interference problem solved.

"Quality and price, Ask Siri feature available on this series","
  I recently ordered the Apple air pods to pair with my Apple Watch, after a brief charge and removal from the wireless charger, they immediately paired with my watch and iPhone. The connection set up was relatively easy and required little time, I would definitely recommend these, gave 4 stars primarily because the advertisement post stated the newest generation and they were offered at a great price.  However after contacting an Apple Representative learned they are not, the sound is flawless and satisfying and the fit is remarkable. Updated star review accidentally entered 1 star.

Can‚Äôt beat them if you have other Apple products,"
  AirPods are great. If you‚Äôre a big Apple fan and have an iPhone, MacBook, etc. you‚Äôll never look back once you have these. I find they could definitely be louder on an airplane, but any other time, volume and sound quality are perfectly good. I‚Äôll admit though I‚Äôm excited to try the AirPod Pros.

Volume control still an issue!,"
  I own both versions of the Apple AirPods. The second version also does not allow you to turn the volume up all the way without a damn apple iPhone! If you use there apple nano to play music through there damn AirPods don't expect to be able to turn the volume all the way up, only siri can do that! BS, that they are able to charge so much for such piss poor functionality! No, I will not buy a damn iPhone!

WORTH EVERY PENNY,"
  I never in my life thought I would pay this much money for basically fancy earbuds. They are so much more than I really thought. The sound quality is amazing. Being able to double tap my earbud to alert Siri or go to the next song is so wonderful. Just taking your earbud out will pause your audiobook or song. As far as I can tell, the battery life is decent and being able to charge them in the case is fantabulous. I am a HUGE fan of Airpods now.

Fit not universal. Works for some ears but not all,"

Love these Air Pods!,"
  These fit in my ear perfectly.  I love the charging case and I love that they pause the music when I pull one out of my ear, and restart when I put it back.  Awesome!  My husband's ears are larger than mine, so he had to order lightweight rubber inserts so they'd stay in his ears.

Seemless Integration,"
  I love how these just work. You really don't have to think about managing anything if you pair it with an iPhone. The only issue I have with these is... I wish it wasn't made from shiny plastic... If it was available in matte colors then I wouldn't be annoyed with how slippery and fingerprinty it gets. Not to mention scratches are way easier to see on shiny plastic. But other than that they are an amazing piece of tech!

You think why should I get these things but yes they really are worth it.,"
  I have these for myself and bought some for my son. I usually just use the speaker or wear my Sony's for music but my headset is bulky and when I am a place like the doc's office these are convenient.  I don't carry a purse anymore so I just hook these to my phone wallet and I have the all the time and the battery life is insane they stay charged for quite a bit of time.

"Not bad, but check what you are getting.","
  An obviously used product. Scuffs on the case, and on the Airpods themselves. The box practically opening inside the amazon packaging. I personally have no problems with used Airpods, but at this price point, you might want to double check to make sure yours are new. Sound is great, so is charging and whatnot, but disappointed on a ""Used-like new"" product to be obviously used to this extent. Even the Airpods had someone's name on them.

I did buy an adapter for the earpiece so it stays in my ear more securely since they are rather expensive and finding a tiny white headphone in snow would be next to impossible.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Steve
Perfect! No issues with connection or anything!,"
  These are perfect for listening to music, playing games on my PC, going on my phone, and I've had no issues whatsoever with the bluetooth connection. The only times where the connection seems to die is if the airpods are low on battery. Charges quickly, battery drains slowly, exactly the way they were designed to.

  Not an Apple/PC guy....I just want things to work, whoever makes it, idc.  They sounded fine, but the fit for me while working out wasn‚Äôt going to cut it.

  I bought it for the gym because it‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôd use it and it was cheaper than the beats pro. If you just want headphones this is great if they can stay in your ear.

One airbus fell down an elevator shaft and the other popped out onto the street and was run over by a car! Unbelievable! I will tell everyone I know to buy the ‚Äúpros‚Äù, as they have 3 ear plug attachments and are soft compared to the original earbuds purchased.  VERY DISAPPOINTING APPLE; THESE WEREN‚ÄôT CHEAP!

I can wear them all day without discomfort! The sounds quality is excellent. The battery life is decent, but I do wish it was longer. The saving grace is that the case charges them quickly, so it‚Äôs easy to keep them at full battery. They also give you a chime as they are nearing the end of their charge.

Buy from Apple,"
  These are great, when they work.  I have to reset and re-pair mine frequently because the left airpod ceases charging.  I don't know why re-pairing is required just for it to charge but it is.  I recommend buying these directly from Apple, at a store, or at least adding Apple Care if buying via Amazon.  They worked great for the first couple months (bought it September 2019) but the last couple weeks I have to constantly re-pair.

AirPods are the only ones to get!,"
  I love the totally wireless function and instant sync with my phone or computer.  These are smaller and more comfortable than any I have tried. Wireless charging works great.  Most comfortable of any I tried using while lying on  pillow.  Sound quality as good as any I have used.  I love these so much, I tossed the PowerBeats3, Bose MIE2i, and 4 other Bluetooth ear buds I had!

Not identified as used at purchase. Complete with ear wax!!,"
  There Air Pods were not identified as used at purchase, and were delivered with the box open, no seal anywhere. My daughter discovered, on her BIRTHDAY that they came up on her Bluetooth as ‚ÄúClark‚Äôs Air Pods‚Äù, obviously not her name, and also came complete with someone‚Äôs EARWAX on one of the Pods. If you want to ruin your daughters Birthday, this is how you do it! Well done, Amazon. Zero Stars for this purchase. ZERO. The only reason for the 1 star is that they will not allow a review with zero stars. Pathetic

Trade Pods,"
  I only gave you 4 stars because my son has trouble inserting the pod in one ear; is not your fault .. years ago he had surgery in that ear and I guess the scars prevent the pod from settling in. He tells me that the AirPod Pro (because of the design) would work. I know the time has passed, but is there a possibility that we can make a trade? We would pay the difference in price....",4.0 out of 5 stars,Albert Menendez

Latest Buds,"
  Love the buds. Still have a problem with the ease of which they slip out but I buy silicone ear grips for that. These are not for noise cancellation.

  The AirPods is amazing and love using them, but the first day I purchased it, my puppy chewed on the case and damaged the case. It looks kinda ugly with the bite marks. It has also been dropped and has scratches. In a nutshell, BUY A CASE, these AirPods get smashed easily, especially the box!

Sounds great except it kept failing out,"
  Overall, great product.  Read all the other reviews and it seems that it fits perfectly for 50% (approximately) of the users who uses it to workout but not for the other 50%.  Unfortunately, I belong the other 50% that they don‚Äôt fit well in my ears.  The left one kept falling out of my ear (the right fells like it was about to but did not) when I use it for running and I have to return it, although my daughter loves them.  I end up buying the Powerbeats Pro and they fits perfectly without any other adjustments once I put them in my ears.

  My wife got these for me for Christmas this year. I‚Äôm also in the IT field and also a musician. So comfortable headphones are pretty high up there on priority and tend to get more personal scrutiny than other travel gear. Additionally in full disclosure I am a former Apple employee and have actively avoided Apple products since leaving the company in 2013. In the past two years they have won me back over with superior products and reliability. These pair great with my iPhone and iPad. Love them.

Poor quality or quality control. Not as advertised.,"
  I have had these less than six months. Battery life was not as advertised, maybe reaching half the time stated. The case stopped charging wirelessly about a week ago. This is especially problematic given the inductive charging model costs more. Moreover the case seems not to hold a charge, being able to charge the AirPods themselves twice before dying. Would not recommend. Buy a Bose model instead.

  Honestly I don‚Äôt know what the hype is. Sure, they‚Äôre wireless headphones but everyone always says they‚Äôre amazing but I just don‚Äôt see it. The sound quality is mediocre. The bass sucks, and the treble is boosted too much to where the sound that you can hear it best at gives you a headache because the treble hurts your ears.

  Everyone knows airpods are great. They wouldn't be such high sellers if they weren't. There's a reason--they are great. You can read all the good about them and it's all true.

"Great!, but not for everyone.","
  First off they sound amazing, some amazing sound with some well balanced bass. A 10/10 listening experience, but like the title says they are NOT for everyone. Maybe i'm just unlucky but they caused immense pain in my ear because they dont fit my ears well. They would stretch my ears natural form. But my girlfriend loves them, fit perfectly for her apparently, so its a case by case use.

  No noise cancellation, but this is not a minus for me. Love that they are earbuds. I hate vacuum in-ear headphones. The only con is that you can't adjust the volume using the sensor - only through Siri or in a standart way with the volume keys on phone. Otherwise they are perfect starting with the sound quality and ending with the battery life.

  For a pricey product and being Apple I thought they‚Äôre would more control to the AirPods. I‚Äôm in a quiet setting and I have to speak Hey Siri turn up the volume or while working out I have to adjust volume on my phone. Ridiculous. Should be able to have the option to adjust it by tapping on the AirPod itself. Guess you have to wait for another one of Apples infamous updates.

  The air pods have GREAT battery, base and sound overall. I used them for 4 hours and they were brought down to 17% but I put them in the case for 20 mins and they were back at 97%. Amazing battery comfortable fit in my ears and base is OUTSTANDING. These little guys can do amazing things.

Not One Size Fits All,"
  These are a great addition to my listening experience. My only reason for 4/5 stars is that they are not ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù. Most ear bud products provide some type of sizing adaptor to accommodate the varied ear canal sizes. I now have to shop for an add-on fix so they don‚Äôt fall out of my ears. Fix this issue and easily a five-star plus!

  The right earbud CONSTANTLY disconnects. I was told it was due to being ""out of date"" with the software, but that's not the case. I updated everything and it still does this.

  I bought these for every day use (wfh & gym). The product came in great condition , so far the sound quality is good and the battery life has been solid.

  Now that I own a pair it will be hard to go without. I have not tried the pro version yet, but the standard is a winner in my book.

I had no issues over 3 miles and had confidence that they wouldn‚Äôt fall out easily and certainly not without noticing.

  I received a pair of defective Airpods. Unless they were not new as advertised. The left one was not working properly and the sound on the right Airpod was jumping.

Watch out for the fake Airpods from Amazon Warehouse,"
  I did not like that I received fake Airpods from Amazon Warehouse. No quality check on these things. Look for the wrong SN (XX0Y12X3X4XX) on the inside of the case along with an incorrect product number A1602. Also really poor sound compared to a real pair. Garbage from Amazon...

So it seems that it may have just been because I had a much older phone. I now have the iPhone XS Max and no longer have any issues. I love them

THESE ARE HORRIBLE AND FAKE!!!!!!,"
  I got these for my granddaughter she has always begged for air pods and I found these and decided I would buy them for her since they were cheap and looked to be real air pods. when they finally came in, the packing and air pods looked untouched and new which I was very happy to see! even though the packing looked different from the real one, I thought it was just an update in their packaging and brushed it off, as the air pods looked new and real. I gave them to my granddaughter and she was so excited to have air pods of her own, she said she loved them and couldn't thank me enough. But that same day she came up to me and said the air pods didn't look like real air pods, I told her that they seemed to look real to me and she pulled up a picture of what apple air pods looked like, I told her that though they looked different, since they seemed real to me, I wasn't going to return them.",1.0 out of 5 stars,latc47
Best I've Tried,"
  If you scroll through my reviews, you're going to see a LOT of wireless Bluetooth earbuds I've tried. Some are good, some not so much. I was looking for the right pair, all the while trying to avoid the Apple Air Pod phenomenon.  I like Apple well enough, but the Air Pods looked like they're just waiting to be lost.",4.0 out of 5 stars,R. M. Ettinger
"Broke after a couple of months, got screwed on the warranty","
  A family member bought me a set of Airpods in mid-July 2019 when they were on sale and then gave them to me as a Christmas gift in December 2019. I used the airpods relatively sparingly at first, but once the weather warmed up and I started to go outside on runs I really began using them quite a bit - maybe three times per week for an hour at a time.",1.0 out of 5 stars,P. Talpos
Customer service made up for my troubles,"
  I ordered a pair of airpods and used them roughly 3-4 months. After that they started to have problems where they would randomly connect to my phone when they were put away in the case. They would also be dead in the case randomly even though I charge them very frequently to keep them topped off. I was frustrated with this issue so I called apple directly and was on hold for roughly 30 minutes while waiting for someone to assist me. I talked to a supervisor for about an update and ran through about an hour worth of troubleshooting and determined there was an unknown defect. He told me that I would have to send them back and then he put me on hold to process an exchange. When he came back he told me to keep the current pair I had and they would overnight another pair directly to me. The one time I had a problem with an apple product they were quick to help me. When I'm due for a new phone I'm switching to Apple because Samsung has screwed me over multiple times. Thanks apple!

"GREAT sound. Other than that, not so great","
  This is edited.  I originally gave the Air Pods 2 stars, but I'm upping it to 4 stars because the sound is really unbelievable.  Original review: I bought Air Pods at Best Buy and was immediately impressed by the sound quality.  By far, the  best quality sound I've found on ear buds.  But, the air pod is too big to stay in my ear like they show in photos. The ear wires cost an extra $20 and have to be removed every time you charge the air pods.  Some control is achieved by simply tapping the air pod, so I found that chewing on food while wearing the air pods can cause the program I'm listening to to pause.  I'm already shopping for new ear buds.  I like the TBI Pro, I own three sets, but they crap out after about two months of use.  The company even removed my model from their website, though it's still being sold here.

"Apple is no longer a quality product, go buy beats","
  So .. just to let everyone kno in case any of u give a sh** .. about two years ago I bought a set of AirPods and a pair of wireless beats.. during that time I‚Äôve had to replace the AirPods 3 times.. never an issue with the beats.. and even with the last pair I bought, which are about 6 months old. I don‚Äôt know how this happened because this has never happened to me with headphones or speakers but they somehow lost sound quality and volume.. not the beats tho. The beats still work as if they were brand new. Not only do the beats work and sound better and are louder.. but the apple product just might be the absolute worst piece of china garbage rip off f*** me in the as* piece of electronic I‚Äôve ever purchased, and I buy a lot of cheap china product off alibaba so that should tell you a lot .. for the next iPhone apple is also switching from top of the line Samsung screens to cheaper china screens as well.. watch as apple destroys itself with cheap parts and rude staff in their stores. Your about to witness the decline of apple, mark my words over the next 5 years sales will drop and someone will purchase and revamp apple .. they are headed toward margins now, where the whole reason they were so successful in the first place was quality, simplicity and branding.. now they are branding to be a cheap china product .. hence why I had to purchase 4 pair of AirPods in just over two years and even now the 4th pair has lost sound quality .. definitely made me hesitant to buy another apple product. Seriously tho, I used to just walk into that store and buy buy buy. I‚Äôve purchase sooooooo many computers and phones and accessories from them without hesitation. Now I don‚Äôt know if I trust the quality anymore, and neither should you!

Surprised with quality.,"

Apple's Airpods | Are They Worth It?,"
  The Airpods by Apple were given to me as a gift.  I would say one of the biggest takeaways right off the bat is the price.  It is expensive.  But is it worth it?  From a straight forward, emotion sort of opinion on them, I have loved having them.  I at first refused to purchase them because I did not see the appeal if I had headphones that worked great anyways.  Once I started to use them though it didn't compare.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Kody R.

Disappointed!!!,"
  I recieved these as a christmas gift only to discover they didn't work as flawlessly as i had hoped. there was no charging cable for the case, like someone took it out. I used my iphone's charging cable i already had, but then discovered the case would not charge. It would not tell me how charged the case was. only when i very first paired it for the first time.. which I had a hard time charging in the first place. it showed up in my phone as i12... instead of airpod.. what is that about!? Had to return these and purchase them elsewhere.. only to find out, when comparing the old ones.. and my new ones.. that the these were actually a fake version of them!! the case looks different. Beware when buying these!!! The Fake ones button in the back is lower then than the real ones. there is no status light in the front, like there should be. the back hinge on the case lid, is even designed a little differently and you can hear a click when the lid closes.. the real one closes silently. the airpods themselves look slightly different. the fake ones has a light on the bottom that shows up when plugged in.. though it doesn't charge. I am disgusted by these that I would be sent fake ones. that is not what i was expecting. I was expecting the real thing! Left airpod in image is the fake one. right side is the real thing.. Beware!!

People Can't Understand You when Talking on Teams over a PC,"
  I bought these during the COVID-19 Pandemic, working from home, and on Teams on a PC all day long.  Listening is fine although has a ""scratchy"" sound compared to the wired Apple headphones.  If I need to talk, however, nobody can understand what I am saying, and I have to revert to the wired headphones.  I'm pretty disappointed overall because they weren't cheap.  The whole purpose for having them was so I wouldn't have to sit at my desk at the end of a 36 inch cord.  I would not buy them again.",3.0 out of 5 stars,MK
The left Airpod suddenly does not connect with the right,"
  For a high priced product, you would expect Apple to produce quality products.  However, within a few months of buying these AirPods, the left airpod no longer connects with the right airpod.  Sound is only coming from the right Airpod.  I've tried turning bluetooth on and off, then forgetting the AirPods on the bluetooth settings menu and re-pairing them.  Nothing works.  The problem is so common that there is an Apple webpage dedicated for fixes to this issue.  Apple needs to admit there is a problem and fix it!!  I have an appointment with the Apple store during Covid and I am crossing my fingers they can fix the issue.

What am I missing?,"
  What a waste of money. I bought these after reading so many glowing reviews. I am sorry that I did. The hard smooth plastic material makes it imposable for them to stay in my ears. They fall out constantly. I am not talking about running or while doing jumping jacks. They fall out while sitting during conference calls and of course walking.  The sound quality is ok, but nothing to get excited about.",1.0 out of 5 stars,Edward Smith

They're surviving!,"
  I can't not give Airpods five stars. If technology could feel, mine would feel traumatized to be owned by me. I was gifted these earbuds two Christmases ago and they have survived me. They still work despite having been munched on by a dog and accidentally ran through the washer and drier. I left them to dry over night, tried them the next morning fully expecting to need a new pair, only for them to work just as normal. Audio did not change, only the microphone wavered -- they can't pick up my voice very well anymore -- but, I can't even pin that on the product itself considering myself. I will be purchasing future generations of this product. I love it.

Amazing airpods.,"
  At first I made a stupid mistake and didn‚Äôt read the reviews before buying. After buying it I thought it was a good idea to read the reviews... The people writing the reviews had got me so scared. Some people stuff came used, other people stuff was fake I was so scared. But these came a day earlier then they was supposed to. And when I opened the box the airpod  box looked they like regular airpods keep in mind these are my second pair. I opened up the airpod box everything was fine. I connected it to my phone put the airpod case on the wireless charging dock. the pair of airpods I got are just fine thank God.

Do not buy,"
  Truly, they are horrible. First off, you will lose them. You will. Maybe not often, but eventually you will misplace them, and when you do, they‚Äôre impossible to find. Secondly, the sound quality and volume suck. There is zero active noise cancelling, the max volume is not loud AT ALL (good luck at the gym), and their overall sound quality is not good. In addition, when using find my iPhone to find these, you won‚Äôt be able to find them because, guess what? They aren‚Äôt connected because the disconnect the second they leave your ear. The only redeeming factor is that they‚Äôre discreet. However this is negated by their HORRIBLE ability to find.

I highly recommend because it is so easy,"
  AirPods are great. These do not have noise cancellation and there are definitely headphones with better sound quality but the ease of use and battery is unmatched. These connect to just about everything and it is so easy to just carry around and pull them out when you need. I use them with my tv, phone, iPad.... I bought one for everyone in my family from Black Friday and we all have been loving them these past months.  They automatically connect to my phone but if I need I can easily switch to my iPad and laptop within seconds. It‚Äôs also great that two different AirPods can connect to one phone like if my gf and I want to listen to the same music. The battery life is a couple hours long and you can fully charge them in the case for less than 20 min. They last more than a day so all you have to do is remember to charge the case every couple days. My only personal problem with them is the case is so small. You definitely need a rubber cover or something because its  slippery.

Disappointed,"
  I bought my Air Pods this in August.  I was so excited to get them!  Well over the last few months,  I have honestly had nothing but problems with them.  Most of the time that I go to use them, the right pod doesn't play sound.  I constantly do have to go through all of the different troubleshooting tasks (inserting at same time, Bluetooth on and off, phone on and off, plugging in to charge, etc., and usually after about 10 or 15 minutes I can get the right pod to connect.  I don't think that this should be.  I paid $180 for these and while the sound quality is good, I should not have to spend so much time and effort trying to get the right pod to connect.  Today before my run I spend about 10 minutes going through all of the troubleshooting steps and finally they both connected.  Then about a mile into my run, the right pod stopped playing sound. This is so not cool.  Not sure what I should do now.  Needless to say I'm disappointed with these AirPods.

  Battery runs out quickly (2 hours talking and you're done.) I was surprised how quickly and had to recharge twice first day i got them.

Why did I wait?!,"
  I wish I hadn‚Äôt procrastinated on purchasing AirPods! I wasted my money on two other ‚Äúknock off‚Äù sets.  These are extremely comfortable ( I have small ears), sound quality is good and battery life is great! I can seamlessly switch from an audiobook to a phone call without losing my place or having to make volume adjustments!  I wore them for hours without any discomfort- and that is saying A LOT, as I am typically unable to tolerate anything in my ears for longer than an hour. The distance I was able to walk away from the phone and still get reception was impressive.  No one that I spoke to on phonecalls complained about quality or feedback noise.  Well worth the price!

Something is wrong,"
  I ordered these before Christmas. My first order never arrived and a 2nd pair was shipped. That being said, I knew what to expect as I already had a pair that I use at work and those perform flawless. The only difference is this pair has the wireless charging case. Once  I received them, I connected them as normal and at first hey seemed to work normally. Then after a few uses, the left pod got to where it didn‚Äôt want to recognize when it was inserted in my ear. I followed the troubleshooting guide on Apple‚Äòs website and reset these AirPods and reconnected. Afterwords, they would intermittently connect normally but I always seem to have some sort of a connection issue. I called Apple support and went through the troubleshooting with them and reset them again per their method and they seemed to work correctly again. After one day the left AirPod did not want to connect again. I called Apple back and re-opened the ticket explaining the situation. They then sent a left pod only to replace what they thought was a defective one and I sent the original back. Now since connecting the new one it is doing the same thing. It takes a long time to connect if at all and most of the time will not recognize when it is inserted into my ear. At this point I am very frustrated. I know how they‚Äôre supposed to act because I have a pair that I use for work. I cannot determine what is wrong with this pair but will be calling Apple back and possibly trying to return all together.

  Bought these for my Wife.  It's one of those gadgets that you don't know you need until you actually have them.  She has told me for years that she didn't want/need AirPods.  As usual, I don't listen!  I finally bought her a pair.  She uses them everyday at work listening to music.  They are much more convenient than using her plug-in apple headphones.  On a personal note, Apple headphones don't stay in my ear so I will be looking at the AirPod Pros.  Not much more I can say that hasn't already been covered in other reviews.

Worth the money,"
  I have bought about 3-4 different earbuds over the past few years.  Resistant to spend the money for the air pods.  Due to working form home and all the calls with COVID, I decided to pull the trigger.  Best thing I ever did for my conference calls and listening to music.  They change from phone to computer (PC) and back without issue.  Don't have any Bluetooth issues at all.  They don't get interference like the cheaper brands, which cut out and have signal interuption.  The only complaint I have is they are not too good for working around the house and working out.  Fall out too easy.  I am looking at aftermarket clips to address this issue.  Love the product and well worth the money.  A wireless charging case is a nice benefit luxury for the extra money.  I recommend it over the cable version.

Defective or knock offs.,"
  I bought these because I lost my first set of AirPods while traveling. I take them out of their charger, get on a zoom call and 20 minutes into the call, the battery on the ear pieces die. It's ridiculous. My first set never had these problems. I would walk for an hour or two listening to podcasts, then put them on again to watch a show without even charging in between. I don't know if I got a defective set or this is some sort of extremely well-replicated knock off but they are terrible.

Caved in!,"
  I didn‚Äôt want to spend this much on earbuds honestly. I have urbeats with the lightning connector but honestly hate that it only connects to my phone and iPad. Doesn‚Äôt work on anything else. I also have the beats solo 3 which are great for travel with its battery life and optional 3.5mm cord but it‚Äôs not something I want to carry daily.  I wanted portable buds I could connect to different devices and was going to just get cheaper Bluetooth buds but decided to splurge and get these.  But now I understand why everyone has these - the ease of use. You just open and it connects to your phone.  No set up needed.  You can connect to other devices (I‚Äôve tried my laptop and kindle) by holding the pairing button.  Battery life is great - I usually only use one at a time and only use occasionally throughout the day with plenty of juice left by the end of the day - I‚Äôm sure I could last a few days on one charge. I use a 3 in 1 wireless charger for my iPhone and Apple Watch with the AirPods which works great.

Best True Wireless Microphones Around,"
  I have used various great quality bluetooth headphones over the past two years, but, unfortunately, they all have terrible microphone quality. Invariably, the person on the other end of a phone call would always have a hard time hearing me and I would get hung up on by some unforgiving call centers. With these, however, people tell me that I sound like I'm on regular wired headphones. I like saving money, but ultimately, other brands aren't worth it, especially when you can't make a simple phone call.",5.0 out of 5 stars,Jeff

Awesome sound and great quality product.,"
  I was skeptical about getting the AirPods because I hated spending so much money on them. My husband got them for me for my birthday and boy am I ever glad that he did. I had purchased for myself a similar product but proceeded to promptly return it after I used the AirPods. I can use them for my iPhone, iPad and iPod (yes, I still have an iPod). They were easy to pair with all three items and I can use them with whichever of the three items I happen to be using at the time. Yes, I highly recommend the AirPods. Trust me, you will NOT regret getting them.

More functional and longer play time,"
  This is my 2nd set of pods as the 1st generation wasn't holding a good charge anymore. Great price on Amazon and I went with the wireless charger, though this has the port to still old school charge. What is really cool about these is that the double tap feature can be adjusted on the phone app. So one can fast forward and the other can rewind. Only thing I want to change is allowing to control volume, otherwise really impressive and I can use these just with my Apple watch!

Works like a charm out of the box,"
  The sound quality is fantastic. Integrating with iPad Pro and iPhone and my MacBook Pro was quite easy. I tried jumping around and spinning, but the AirPods stayed in my ears without issue. They are quite comfortable. Can have them in all day at work and I barely notice them. My only issue, not enough to drop a star as for me it was not a big deal, is that the tapping of the AirPods to perform actions is a little difficult. I find that the touchable surface area for this is mostly covered by my ear. It takes me a few attempts to get this to work.

üëÅ‚ù§Ô∏èüçè,"
  Apple has always had great quality to their products, with the AirPods second generation making small but functional upgrades over the first. Sound quality is great, with noise cancellation being perfectly acceptable. Where Apple really shines with AirPods is in their usability and friendliness towards other devices in the Apple ecosystem. They automatically pair when removed from the case, and automatically pause audio when removed from the ear. AirPods are also discreet, perfect for browsing PH while sitting with your family at the dinner table. The pods can be prone to falling out, but exercising and activities shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. No unsightly wires either. The charging case features a small, durable, rugged form factor that is tough and hard to break. Capable of charging AirPods 2-3 times from one charge. It fits nicely in the pocket, or chocolate starfish, wherever is more comfortable. I found many different skins for the case that fit like a glove, or a condom, which I‚Äôm told is good, I wouldn‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt wear either.

Great Quality,"
  Got these over a year ago and they have stood the test of time as far as quality. They are very sensitive and when using to speak to someone, they are very sensitive and they pick up all the sounds around you which makes it very annoying for the person you are talking too.  The sound on these are amazing. And the battery life initially was mind-blowing. After having them for a bit, if I am using them to talk on the phone and listen to some music, they won't last more than an hour. As opposed to 4-6 hours when first bought.

"Damaged packaging, missing instructions","
  Item appears to be in good condition, but the description ‚Äúlike new in original packaging‚Äù was a bit much. The box was torn at one corner and, most importantly, the instructions were missing. I had to contact Apple for instructions on how to set up and use them. A small inconvenience for me, but if I had given these as a gift, I would‚Äôve been quite upset. I understand they‚Äôre ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù, but it should at least include the instruction manual. They also weren‚Äôt charged. When I finally figured out how to set them up, the AirPods had a 12% charge and the case was at 0%.

The battery life is impressive as he‚Äôs charged the case and AirPods only once and it‚Äôs still going after 3 days. These are also wireless charging capable in addition to the wired charging. I give it 4 stars just because of the price. Seems a little expensive for ear buds, but my grandson loves them. He likes not having a wired set of ear buds.

"Good Sound, Good Fit, Sub-par Battery","
  Sounds about as good as the 15$ Vemonk WIRED earbuds to me and has a good fit in the ear (unlike the rubber cone versions which are uncomfortable to me), but the battery is only about 4 hours so if you're using them for large periods of time like I do you might need two to switch between. Still better than a 40$ pair of generic Chinese brand wireless earbuds that simply don't work, or (to me) 70$ Raycons which have my most hated design with the rubber piece so I spend double to not deal with that.

Right bud stopped working after a week,"
  They are fun and useful. Using Siri is easy with voice command. The audio in the right bud became loud on the outside and quiet on the inside after about a week of use. We had already passed the return window by 3 days. Apple walked us through factory reset but it did not fix the problem.  They are sending a replacement in the mail, but it is disappointing for an apple product to break so quickly. Hopefully the replacement pod will not malfunction.

Questioning Wireless Capability,"
  I ordered these thinking I was saving a little money but now I‚Äôm questioning if they are truly wireless. My wife just recieved her free set from Apple for purchasing a Mac. The box for her headphones is identical to the ‚Äúwireless‚Äù ones I purchased here on Amazon from ‚ÄúApple‚Äù. At least they are AirPods and they work great. I‚Äôm not ready for the wireless yet but was thinking when I get there would be great. If they do wireless will be a good savings if not then I just paid $10 more but did get it faster than Apple Store. Small trade offs. That‚Äôs the reason I did a 2 Star because I can‚Äôt confirm.

  These are standard run of the mill air pods from apple. I wish they were louder, but they are great for truly cord free earphone experience.

  I received genuine Apple AirPad 2's (wireless charging) in original packaging. What's to say about them that hasn't already been said? They're designed by Apple for Apple products and work exactly as described by apple, with all the features they list and nothing extra (or less).

"They‚Äôre Air Pods, What Else is there to say","
  These 3rd gen AirPods are awesome.  I take long walks in the morning with my dogs and I love being being able to listen to my music while I‚Äôm walking.  The fit my ears perfectly so I don‚Äôt have to worry about them falling out.  The sound is superb and they have lots of technical things that mean a lot.

believer,"
  Okay, I made fun of everyone who ever bought air pods since they came out.  not sure why I got them, but OH MY GOD.  they're great.  they're solid in my ears.  and if you take one out, the music stops playing.  so it's perfect for 1) if one ""fell out"" while running....which was only my fear *before* i bought them.  not after! and 2) if you need to talk to someone quickly.  as soon as you put it back in your ear it plays again.

Awesome Earbuds and Authentic,"
  These earbuds are dope! They stay in my ear no matter how much I move and dance. The sound, noise reduction, and overall look and feel is top notch. I also love how convenient it is to have wireless earbuds so I can move around more freely.  I really wouldn‚Äôt expect anything less from Apple.

Good Purchase,"
  I bought these especially for the Live Listen option which essentially functions as hearing augmentation.  This works well; don‚Äôt expect perfection but you will get amplification.  Good sound quality on phone calls and people are able to hear me speaking well too.  Okay musical quality though the depth of sound could be improved.  Live Listen and phone call utility were my priorities and these are great!

Great wireless earphones,"
  I love these. Quality is better than the apple headphones the iPhone comes with. I‚Äôm hearing more sounds in the same songs than before. They fit comfortably in my ears. I can still hear things going on around me at 25% volume. At 50% volume nothing around me is audible. Comes with wireless charging case, wireless earphones, and a lightning charging cable.

  I believe i may of received a defective model, because sometimes i leave it plugged in for about an hour, with an iPad adapter mind you, and when i start charging the case is at 0% but when i open it and check the battery on my iPhone, it shows like 6%?!? the airpods are updated and i dont understand why the case doesnt register the actual charge on them, like this has to be a defective model, i will take them straight to apple to see if they can give me a replacement üëÄ

Awesome TINY Headphones,"
  Got this for my son‚Äôs birthday, he‚Äôs been asking for Airpods for Christmas. Basically these are 2.1 [between 2Gen and Pro], main feature differences from 2Gen: charges both wirelessly/wired, newer chip thus Siri enabled, longer battery life, slightly more affordable than Pro. Tip: $20 promo, get Apple Care, I see these smashed/littered in the park!

  My son saved all his Christmas and Birthday money so that he could purchase these headphones. He absolutely loves them and uses them daily. He says its well worth the money and I would agree.

great wireless buds!!,"
  I love these AirPods. Love the wireless charging. Love the fact that the case recharged the pods when they‚Äôre not in use. Only downside is that I find myself using a high volume compared to other ear buds. Not a deal breaker, but it tells me that any active noise cancellation is minimal.

  One of the best Apple products I've purchased recently. They pair easily and are great for running as they don't fall out easily.

  I have constant connectivity issues with these. One will connect and the other one won‚Äôt. I just spent half an hour trying to fix the problem without any solution.

Overpriced headphones.,"
  As always you are paying for the brand name. I bought these and I am returning them in less than 24 hours. I have a bootleg LG tone which I purchased for $10 which gives me the same sound quality and same noise cancelling as the $200 fancy apple AirPods. I would advise you to get this if you are a die hard apple fan or you want something built specifically for an iPhone. If those things are not important to you then spend $200 on a nice set of Bose headphones which can actually enhance your music listening experience.

Better Fit Than AirPods Pro... For Me!,"
  ¬†I couldn't post this video regarding a comparison between these and the airpods pro so I thought I would post it here. If you are wondering between these and the AirPods Pro... I would go for these if they fit your ears. If normal AirPods don't fit then try the Pro's.
",5.0 out of 5 stars,Dan
One Size Doesn‚Äôt Fit All,"
  I was excited to get these as I am an iPhone user and needed new headphones for working out. The overall product quality is great per Apple however the design of these are flawed. During my first run one of the AirPods fell out my ear into the pavement gashing the AirPod. Thankfully it still works. Then the same happened at the gym except they fortunately just fell onto a rubber mat. These are definitely not a one size fits all product and will randomly fall out of my ears even walking around the house. The remedy to this problem has been silicone AirPod covers for $10 that better secure them in my ear. It‚Äôs annoying that I have to place on the covers before I use the AirPods and remove the covers to charge the AirPods. I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy these again and would advise anyone with apparently larger ear canals like myself to steer clear of these.

They Fall Out Easily,"
  I have a love / hate relationship with these. I have small ears and sometimes find it difficult to keep them in my ears. I couldn‚Äôt imagine trying to workout with these in because I can barely shift and they will fall out. I like to use them when riding in the car and they do have a good sound quality but I cannot get over the fit. They also make my ears sore somehow. I didn‚Äôt think it was possible to use earbuds incorrectly but maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong??? My husband has no issues using them but he also has larger ears. I may have to give these to him and find something different üòî.

Great,"
  Long story short, sure these are great if you already have an iOS device and want to take advantage of auto connect/play/pause, touch controls and whatever else to try and justify the price tag. If not, just save your money buy a cheaper set of generic buds and press the pause button on your screen. Personally, I have carried these and used them exclusively for almost a year and have no complaints. I highly enjoy the AirPods and the sound quality is great but nothing spectacular. They fit ok, but aren't the most comfortable buds. That said, I recently switched over to a $10 set of generic Bluetooth ear buds to carry at work and find that design to be much more comfortable, they're waterproof and I'm not nearly as worried about misplacing them.

  Delightfully surprised that these are genuine, 2nd gen AirPods. The sound quality is much better than the wired (lightning cable) earbuds, and they were shipped in padded packaging so they arrived without damage (my main concern when ordering).

  The pods kept slipping out of my ears when I was wearing them. These don't come with the rubber tips, only the Airpods Pro do.
