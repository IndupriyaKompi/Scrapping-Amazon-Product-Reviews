# Scrapping-Amazon-Product-Reviews

The task is to perform Sentiment Analysis on any product reviews of any product of your choice (atleast with 10k reviews). Here, in this repository, let's just obtain the data.

The product reviews can be obtained simply by scrapping directly from the amazon website using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org), which is an open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites in python.

If you're wondering if it's legal?! Check out [this](https://www.blog.datahut.co/post/is-web-data-scraping-legal) blog.

NOTE: I would recommend you to use google chrome
